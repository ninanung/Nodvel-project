I make this with Nodvel! Yeah!

## what is Nodvel?

Nodvel is compound word of node.js + novel, like name of "Renpy".

Sometimes, i want to make my own visual novel. And i know some guys want it too. But problem is, we don't know how to use tools. For using tools, we need to learn program language. Well, we can learn, but actually there's someone who don't want to learn. "I just want to make visual novel, not program!" and i think it is right.

So, simply, this project is visual novel making web service. I think this service must have some function.
1. People can sign in and log in.
2. People can make visual novel that has background, charactor and text. If i can do, plus BGM.
3. Making page must be comfortable and easy to make.
3. People can see other person's visual novel and write comment.
4. Also can give a 'Like' to novels.
5. People can see what novel has many 'Like'.

I make this for study. So i can't tell when this project end.
